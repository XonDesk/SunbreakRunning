I hired Matt after just one conversation about training. The depth of his knowledge of running and his passion for the work of coaching were immediately apparent in talking with him: I knew I'd found a good coach. Throughout the following months, I became a totally different athlete. Matt works especially well with persistent injuries. I have always been held back by injuries (particularly Achilles tendinopathy and ITBS) but through the strength programs that I received, I found my injuries retreating and my running imbued with a whole new type of strength. He is also a very holistic coach who will try to understand your life, how your running fits into it, and what motivates you to run. I had never worked with someone whose coaching was so considerate of my whole person, but it's an approach that pays off. Through my training, he helped me to become fitter, faster, and stronger, which is the mark of a good coach. Matt, however, bears the mark of a truly great coach: he deftly passes on not only the routine motions of training but his deep knowledge of its methods. This turns out to be the X-factor that carries athletes through plateaus and into the next level.
