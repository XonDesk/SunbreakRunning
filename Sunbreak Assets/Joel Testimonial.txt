Working with Coach Matt has been incredibly eye-opening. After five years of trail running, I came to Matt with a goal: train smarter, avoid another femoral stress fracture, and get faster for the Seattle Marathon. He delivered on all fronts. Matt’s approach is both data-driven and deeply personal—he took the time to understand me as an athlete and made it clear this was a two-way street. His programming is creative, individualized, and always backed by a strong “why” behind each workout. Anytime something big or small came up, Matt was quick to respond via text/phone call. I finally feel like I know what I’m doing as an athlete and how to keep doing it without getting hurt.
