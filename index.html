												<blockquote>
													<p>"Working with Coach Matt has been incredibly eye-opening. After five years of trail running, I came to Matt with a goal: train smarter, avoid another femoral stress fracture, and get faster for the Seattle Marathon. He delivered on all fronts. Matt's approach is both data-driven and deeply personal—he took the time to understand me as an athlete and made it clear this was a two-way street. His programming is creative, individualized, and always backed by a strong 'why' behind each workout. I finally feel like I know what I'm doing as an athlete and how to keep doing it without getting hurt."</p>

												<blockquote>
													<p>"I hired Matt after just one conversation about training. The depth of his knowledge of running and his passion for the work of coaching were immediately apparent. Throughout the following months, I became a totally different athlete. Matt works especially well with persistent injuries. Through the strength programs that I received, I found my injuries retreating and my running imbued with a whole new type of strength. He is also a very holistic coach who will try to understand your life, how your running fits into it, and what motivates you to run. Matt bears the mark of a truly great coach: he deftly passes on not only the routine motions of training but his deep knowledge of its methods."</p>
